## How to start a new Papers We Love chapter

**First things first**: Please read and abide by our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). This is very important.

**Next step:** Have a chapter repository created within the Papers We Love organization. Open an issue on this repo requesting a chapter repo and telling us about yourself, who is helping you out, where we can find you online (twitter, etc) and where you're planning on starting the chapter.

One of the Papers We Love administrators will get in touch with you and once everything is squared away will create the repo for your planned chapter. You will be added to a `chapter-organizers` team and given read / write access to the repo.

Use the chapter repo for discussions, local content and communication outside of Slack. Think of it as a resource to help with continuity - if you hand the chapter over to someone else in the future, they don't have to start from scratch.

### General tips on running a chapter:

* If you're having trouble securing a space or are in need of funding for a PWL event, please seek out sponsorship, as it can go a long way toward a chapter's continuity and longevity.

* Get help. Organizing a group can be exhausting, the more you are the easier it gets (plus you'll never be at a loss for speaker/paper ideas).

* One way to get help is to join our #startingapwl Slack channel by signing-up!

* Ask someone you're really excited about to talk. Michael Bernstein's blog was exactly the kind of thing we thought embodied the papers we love ethos, i.e. working/practicing programmers with an interest in keeping one toe in academia.

* To keep the same look-and-feel for your meetup.com page, check out our assets.

* Reference our Code of Conduct on your meetup.com/event page.

* Get your meetup.com/fb/other group started and pull request a link to it in the repo's readme.

* Once you have held your first meeting, let us know so we can add you to our list of active chapters. You will need to hold regular meetings to stay listed.
